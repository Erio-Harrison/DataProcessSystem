# Smart Autonomous Vehicle Management System

Uses C++ code to implement core algorithms for high-performance computing 

and Java to complete application layer development

Before run Java's code, run in the engine directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will generate a shared library named `libdataprocessing.so (Linux)` or `dataprocessing.dll (Windows)` or `libdataprocessing.dylib (Mac)`.

So we need to write a scripting language to run the program.
